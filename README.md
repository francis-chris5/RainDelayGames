# RainDelayGames
This is the source files from a framework I developed for small time-killing games on Android devices. Likely to go with small educational games I like to write: more fun than the average [math] homework, though they're really just glorified multiple choice things (for example instead of chooing radio button 'b' you track down and kill zombie 'b'), and as a teacher I can still collect data and statistics on how students are progressing through the material.
The games currently on there are just for testing/design purposes, not even going to be refactored, just scrapped when the objects and engine plans come together more thoroughly for finished versions.
